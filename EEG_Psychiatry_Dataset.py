# EEG dataset with ~1,150 features per subject extracted from 19-electrode 10-20 system
# Features include:
# - Demographics: sex, age, education, IQ, disorder info
# - AB (Absolute power): Mean power in 6 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, highbeta, gamma)
#   across 19 electrodes = 114 features
# - COH (Coherence): Mean pairwise coherence between all electrode pairs for each band
#   = 171 pairs Ã— 6 bands = 1,026 features
# Each row = 1 subject with summary statistics (no time series), classic p >> n problem
